# avr-piezo-piano

This is a very simple, extensible first project to get to grips with the basics of AVR.

This project uses the atmega-328 to drive a piezo buzzer at frequencies defined at the top of the file. It is trivial to extend to have more keys.

TODO: commit Makefile, move defines and functions to seperate files, document code properly.
